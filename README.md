# OOPS concepts using CPP
# modelling a physical entity REFRIGERATOR into various components like Freezing Component, Light, Temp control unit Door etc
# The project aims to use Dependency Injection , Polymorphism, Inheritance ,Encapsulation and Abstraction
# the further scope includes using Factory based approach to accomadate different styles of components for the final product
# The user interface deals with opening, closing, setting temperature without having knowledge of which components are being used in the REFRIGERATOR.
